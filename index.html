				<p>Health and Nutrition are major parts of human development and should always come first. Eating healthy can lead to people becoming productive citizens who engage in the word around them. However, Memphis has put the health of its citizens last.</p>
				<p>The heavy amounts of unconscious bias within the city has cause African- Americans to be placed under higher amounts of stress and less likely to receive outside help from a physician. Basically, being black is bad for your health. </p>

				<p>Fast food and soda companies purposely advertise to blacks. Using black models and hip-hop music in commercials are all ways for companies to entice blacks to eating unhealthily. On the other side companies that produce health conscious foods advertise to whites. All four of these companies use stereotypes of races within Memphis to promote their brand. </p>

			<p>Rib Joints are popular among African-Americans, especially in Memphis. Due to their lower prices and favored food, rib joints can seem like the perfect option. WRONG! the foods offered in rib joints are high in fats, sodium, and sugars. Eating out also allows the possibility of food being contaminated with germs. Ew! </p>

			<h4>Education</h4>
			<p>Power Score Test Preparation list “eat dinner” as the second most important task to complete the night before taking a major exam like the ACT(ACT). The site explains that test takers should eat a meal high in carbohydrates. If lower-income families do not have access to the nutrition they need then how are they going to compete against children who are able to eat a balanced breakfast and dinner. Nutritional racism already sets children back and farther away from their goals.</p>

			<h4>GEMS</h4>
			<p>In 2010, The Memphis Girls' Health Enrichment Multi-site Studies (GEMS) developed a 2-year evaluation to view obesity prevention programs and their efforts on African- American girls. By the end of the 2-years the experts suggested that the girls needed to reduce their sugar intakes by drinking less sodas. However, these dietary changes seemed to be more successful in the younger girls which means obesity prevention should start before the teen years.</p>

			<h4>MAKE IT KNOWN! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn"></span> </h4>
			<p>The best way to end unconcious bias, is to make people concious of it. Share this page with friends, family, co-workers, or any one you come into contact with.</p>

			<h4>TALK TO A PSYCHOLOGIST! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> </h4>

			<h4>GO VEGAN! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-leaf"></span> </h4>
			<p>A change in diet from carbs and sugar to grains and veggies can be all your body needs to bounce back from the damage of obesity. A vegan diet (or those alike) also promotes cooking and dinning home. </p>

			<h4>EXCERICSE MORE! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart-empty"></span> </h4>
			<p>Exercise your legs, arms, and your right to vote. It is important that the politicians that represent Memphis understand the state of our city and present ways to bring change. </p>
